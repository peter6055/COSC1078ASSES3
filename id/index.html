                <p>My opinion of my ideal job does not change, because up to now my most interesting and suitable job is programming, and the required general skills are not only necessary for a person to work, but also to life. Also, the required IT-specific skills are very cost-effective, most IT employers need those skills too which means working on this can develop myself. Totally speaking, it is worthy.

        <p>I have worked in the IT industry for 5 years. I have worked as a system administrator for 5 years and this is also my favourite job. As you can see this job requires a lot of structuring skills. When we are doing a project or management. Sometimes there are things we didnâ€™t familiar with. It requires me to do some research, plan it and making decisions. Of course, there might be more tasks that I need to work on such as analysis needed, troubleshooting, organisational skills and problem-solving. When I start my job I often make a mistake because I didn't plan and do enough preparation. Also, working with the software team and other colleges are also important in this job. This job is quite busy, everything regarding IT might belong to you. I need to know how to management's time and tasks smoothly. </p>
        <br>

        <p>For the specific skills, the IT administrator needs to know the amount of software language to help you make tools, understand the logic of development and debug. Understanding more and more computing language might make you work smoothly and easily. Windows, Office and Linux is a basic requirement for every IT job. Tools skills are the most important because I need to know how to use different tools to finish my job.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After reading all the requirements, My job of cloud support engineer is in the category of system administration and I will still choose this job. This job requires almost all of the general skill and IT skills. For me, I think ranking is not important. As my understanding and the experience of this job, you need to know everything rather than getting deep knowledge of one thing. For my 3 years at uni, I know I am quite familiar with hardware or network management skills.  I will be focusing more on software knowledge improvements. Overall, this job is challenging. For standing inside the safe zone and challenging things I will accept the challenge.</p>

        <p>IT Job Titles:Data Analyst</p>

        <p>I have been learning IT knowledge since I was at the age of 16. The first programming language that I learn is C. The first job for an IT specific area that I had is an internship in a company named global tone communication technology Co.Ltd. In that workplace, the general skills that I need to master are some social interaction skills, cyber communication skills. As far as I am concerned, those soft skills are required in different kinds of workplaces.</p>
        <br>

        <p>For detailed information technology skills, I need to master machine learning skills, I need to learn Matlab, Octave as what machine learning requires. I need to learn python language, go language for machine learning algorithms in data science. I need to learn artificial intelligence algorithms for data science either.</p>
        <br>

        <p>My job for data science will be to get into a data centre and then help target clients to store data. By using algorithms and AI technology, those will help the data that I gathered to generate reports or results. Besides, security or data is in the same priority as data science, I need to use those kinds of technology either.</p>

        <p>My thoughts on future job choices have not changed because I chose to study this major precisely because I am interested in it, and when I am learning to edit web pages, I like to study alone and then boldly try some unique styles. This feeling makes me very excited. In addition, I will learn more skills in the future, in order to make more choices in future work and to make myself more confident in future job choices.

        <p>My choice of ideal job has not changed, because what I am most interested in in IT major is game design. In terms of the requirements of this career, I need to learn some additional skills about graphics and design. In addition, this occupation requires a lot of general skills, and it requires experience in different work platforms to be qualified for this occupation. Basic IT skills, teamwork and communication skills are also important. During the three years in the university, I hope to learn all the necessary skills for this career, and train my team communication and cooperation ability when participating in various team activities and assignments.</p>
