           <p><strong style="font-size: 35px;">Overview</strong><br/></p>
           <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >In recent years, more and more people in Melbourne like to use convenient online shopping to buy all kinds of goods, ranging from daily necessities to household appliances. The online shopping market in Melbourne also has great growth every year. According to statistics, the number of people using online shopping has reached 4.93 million each year, of which more than 400,000 are Chinese. When Peter, the founder of SHOPMY, noticed the gap in the Chinese online shopping market in 2019, he immediately conducted a market survey and after careful consideration, SHOPMY, a shopping platform targeted at Chinese people, was born.</p>
           <br>
       </br><br>
   </br>
   <p><strong style="font-size: 35px;">Motivation</strong><br/></p>
   <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >The biggest motivation for the establishment of the SHOPMY shopping platform is that according to market research, the mainstream online shopping platforms existing in Melbourne cannot meet the shopping needs of Chinese consumers. On the one hand, slow logistics delivery, high freight costs, low customer service efficiency due to language barriers, and transnational factors make Chinese more inclined to offline shopping. Second, platforms widely used by the Chinese, such as WeChat and information platforms such as Melbourne today, are not protected by the platform because they do not support gold logistics services. Third, due to the non-localization of Taobao, a large Chinese online shopping platform, the diversified advantages of its products cannot be displayed and the logistics are inconvenient. Also, the B2C business model of local Melbourne supermarkets cannot meet the shopping needs of consumers at all.</p>
   <br>
</br><br>
</br>
<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" ><br>According to the market survey, it is concluded that the mainstream online shopping platforms in Melbourne are not suitable for and cannot meet the shopping needs of the Chinese. For example, although eBay, as a shopping platform widely used by Australians, has a complete range of goods and supports the transaction of new and second-hand goods, its operation mode is relatively complex and different from the logic used by Chinese platforms. Besides, the language barrier causes the Chinese are rarely willing to contact and try to use eBay for shopping.<br/></p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" ><br>According to the market survey, it is concluded that the mainstream online shopping platforms in Melbourne are not suitable for and cannot meet the shopping needs of the Chinese.<br/></p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" ><br>For example, although eBay, as a shopping platform widely used by Australians, has a complete range of goods and supports the transaction of new and second-hand goods, its operation mode is relatively complex and different from the logic used by Chinese platforms. Besides, the language barrier causes the Chinese are rarely willing to contact and try to use eBay for shopping. For international students and vacationers who choose to study in Melbourne, second-hand goods are their preference. For them, Though Gomart has efficient services and logistics support, it lacks the necessary goods such as clothes, electronic products, and furniture for their daily life. While Gumtree, a second-hand goods shopping platform widely used in Australia, supports C2C, but it has two major disadvantages, namely, no gold logistics and irregular classification.<br/></p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" ><br>SHOPMY will operate under the o2o model of new and second-hand shopping malls. Also, the localized development of the platform and the local gold logistics in Australia make people's transactions more smooth. Plus Chinese use logic and design without language barriers. This online shopping platform makes it more convenient and safe for people to use.<br/></p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 35px;">Description</strong><br/></p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >This program is divided into the three sections which are buyer sections, seller sections and staff sections. When the user enters the app, first it will show the homepage section, the top of the homepage is a search bar. You can find products by entering keywords and filter the products through the filter bar. There is a chat bubble on the left side of the search bar, you can view order messages and chat with merchants or customer service. Below the search bar is an advertisement box, order box, group purchase box, popular items, and recommended items. After you find a product you like by searching bar or viewing the recommended product column, the product section will be displayed for you, which contains product pictures, product descriptions, and product reviews. At the bottom of this section, there are several functions such as bookmarking, chatting with merchants, adding to the shopping cart, and buying directly. After clicking those buttons, you can jump to the related page. In the bottom middle position is the shopping cart section, which is mainly the checkout process, displaying the selected product information, after confirming the information, buyer need to enter the personal information and address, then buyer can pay the bill through Google pay, Apple pay, credit card, Portal, WeChat and Alipay. At the bottom right is the profile section, which is divided into four columns. The first column shows the products you have seen, your favorites, and the products you care about. The second column is your order, the function is to find the products waiting to be paid, waiting to be shipped, in delivery, waiting for refund, and product reviews. The third column is your wallet, which can display the incoming and outgoing of your accounts, and the last column shows your coupons, points, help and settings. On the right side of the top picture is the link to enter the seller's system. There are four sections in it. The first is the order, which is the same as the buyerâ€™s order part. The second is the product management section, you can add and change your product details. The third is your discount method, mainly to create coupons for your products. The last column is used to display a summary of all of your product information, including the total number of products, total number of reviews, the rate at which you respond to customer messages, and the rate of unfulfilled orders. In addition to the app, there is also a management system used by employees to manage order issues, user issues, funds, data, track and manage products.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" ><br>The project of SHOPMY needs some external services to support. It needs google map API to support its delivery service. The google map Distance Matrix API is a service that provides travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations. The API returns information based on the recommended route between the start and endpoints, as calculated by the Google Maps API. Our SHOPMY project will get connected to Australian google map service to make sure our logistics data can be transformed via Distance Matrix API. Google has many commercial satellites and the google map geolocation API service will help us gather geographical data in Australia. Australian street view services also need to be linked via google map API service either. Next, our data needs to be stored in a secure place in cyberspace, those valuable assets include our commercial agreement, legal documents, banking information, transaction source documents, business model, technology intellectual property and so on. Our SHOPMY prefer to choose google cloud storage, amazon simple storage service, or Backblaze storage to do cloud storage. We have compared those three cloud storage services, compared the locations of their data centres in the United States and Australia, and efficiency of their upload speed, but the final decision is still being discussed. In addition, we are finding extern financial services and request their API to get connected to our SHOPMY platform. Royal pay is an API solutions provider who specializes in connecting Aussie companies and Chinese payment platform Alipay and WeChat pay. Our SHOPMY will use Royal payâ€™s service to let people from China to use Alipay and WechatPay to do the payment on our platform to buy goods. For Aussie major large banks like commonwealth bankâ€™s clients, National Australian Bankâ€™s clients, HSBCâ€™s clients, Westpacâ€™s clients and ANZâ€™s clients, we need to connect to their users to make sure they can link their bank cards to our SHOPMY platform. For some other bank cardholders with Visa or Master service, we will find opportunities with Visa or Master to apply the availability of their clients to purchase on our platforms.<br/></p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >When we start this project we focus on two things. The first is we want to lower down the cost of developing an application. The second is we want to let this app be able to work without upgrading in 1-1.5 year and it can be flexible for future upgrades    . We are striking a balance between user experience and budget. After a few weeks of discussion. I decide to use vue.js as our front end system. Using nvue view wonâ€™t affect performance like HTML 5 in web-view. Also, it can avoid the HTML 5 application rejected by Apple or Android. Also, we use objective-c and java to build native plugins for native SDK such as Apple Pay, Google Pay or other API required to run in iOS or Android. Python and PHP design for using in the back-end system. As the above-mentioned, we want to make this app more satisfying in Australia. We connect a lot of APIs provided by Google, Stripe or royal-pay. These APIs are running by PHP and Python.

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >Since our work is based on Internet transactions on the Internet, we need various basic skills for the team. Firstly, to design an application we need a team leader and he must have leadership skills because he needs to lead us to achieve every task and overcome some challenges. Also, the team members need to have the skills of planning in order to plan the team project. On the one hand, the team members need communication skills and problem-solving skills to overcome problems and communicate and cooperate well, and on the other hand, we need writing, teamwork, creativity research, management, english skills because these skills are basically based on a mature department, they are necessary for every company. Moreover, the group members need the skills for programming, and our team members have skills of NET programming and HTML programming for the website design. And other members have skills of Java, Javascript, Python and some other languages for programming. Also, we have the SQL and database skills to achieve overall planning and management. </p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >In this assessment, we had successfully collaborated together and finished our assessment 2. Everyone provides their idea in some of our discussion and everyone show their understanding of how this assessment work. The only thing that needs to be improved is our teammate didnâ€™t familiar with using English to discuss online. This didnâ€™t be a big problem as we can discuss in other language and keep our progress moving. I am quite surprised by the project every did. When we discussed our project idea and everyone needs to write it after meeting. Everyone can successfully finish their work without misunderstanding content. Especially who didnâ€™t have any experience in IT. They produce professional research and analysis of the project idea. Teammate doing an overview, description and motivation are really hard working. They represent my project idea with a different viewpoint that I never think about. And focus more marketing stuff I didnâ€™t write in assessment 1. I have learned how a group collaboration together to achieve a goal. This group make me understand an IT project cannot be finished by one person. Sometimes you can't make it on your own teamwork works best. I think I am quite familiar with using Github or website coding. In this project, I am like to help people didnâ€™t familiar with HTML/CSS and Github. Also, I am leading to make everyone to try new things such as research on IT technology we never known or modify HTML. If there is another chance to start this project again.  I might recommend our team to try some new project idea rather than taking a market exiting idea.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >I did lots of contribution for this introduction to information technology assignment 2, the personal information that I submitted to the group google doc is what I used from my assignment 1, as well as my learning style test, Idea job. In the group meeting, I contributed many valuable suggestions on Business to business industry data, financial information of online business to the whole group. I host two group meeting on Microsoft team to make sure everybody can have chanced to contribute their suggestions. I also contributed some advices on the leadership skills, teamwork skills on how to finish a group work among different cultures like East Asian culture, western culture. That will increase efficiency on team-work goals as far as I am concern.I contributed two IT technologies articles, the first one is machine learning, and the second one is cyber security.  I used to learn Andrew Ngâ€™s machine learning course and I used to read his book <Machine learning yearning> and his website deeplearning.ai to absorb of knowledge for this article, and other professional sources like Stanford Artificial intelligence laboratory, MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Carnegie Mellon University artificial intelligence lab, Microsoft AI lab are the professional and reliable source that I found academic journal or report on machine learning, neural network and deep learning. Also, cyber security is another article that I wrote in IT technologies.  I use FBI cyber-crime database to search some most wanted report, and I use some professional reports from some cyber securities like FireEye to use examples to illustrate cyber security. Some source of data I used to from government websites like Chinese ministry of public security, Russian Federal government,  American central intelligence agency to find cyber-attack cases. The HTML file of industry data that I created is very simple, not like other members good-looking websites.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >Totally speaking, I think everything has done very well through Peterâ€™s management, every member of this group has done almost everything in time, and everyone has similar issues to finish, this is very hard to see. In this assignment, I am very honored to be responsible for the following projects and I think I have done well, except for the part that everyone must complete such as personal profile and industry data, I have finished the part of IT work, made IT work webpage and half text content of description of project ideal. There is an obvious problem that we need to improve. When we were discussing, we couldnâ€™t come up with a good solution that we all agreed, we spent lots of time but less gain. There is one surprise thing, Peter is not only a good manager but also a good IT professional. The most important thing I learned from group work is, one plus one is not equal to two. I am a person who advocates personal strength, but this group work ensures me that the strength of a team is stronger than the absolute strength of a person.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >Through this teamwork, all issues are progressing smoothly, and all the members cooperate very harmoniously. But what needs to be improved is that each member is not very active during the group discussion and needs to be reminded to actively participate in the recording. I hope that future cooperation can improve this. What surprised me through this group work is that each team member has so many technical skills and everyone has their own skills and even proficiency. Of course, a successful group work is inseparable from the active cooperation of everyone. So I think that each of us has a strong sense of responsibility to complete each task to lead to the smooth completion of the final task. Although this task also uses github and HTML related technologies, it is different from assignment1. This time the technical requirements are stricter and the degree of difficulty is higher. This time I am responsible for the design of the project idea webpage. I feel that I want to design a perfect website. My skills need to be improved and I need to practice more in the future.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >In this group assignment 2, all our team members did a good job of completing their respective tasks and were able to complete the group assignment well. Although everyone has put forward their own ideas and opinions, we should be more active in the group discussion. We should be more active in expressing our opinions and ideas. During the discussion meeting, we allocated our respective tasks well, made good use of Github and HTML in our group assignment 2, and put a lot of time and effort into completing our respective parts. Everyone did a great job on their part. In this group assignment, I learned that I should be more active in expressing my views during the discussion, and I should prepare all my ideas before the discussion. This will make the discussion meeting better. Moreover, I have learned the communication methods with team members. This assignment requires cooperation and communication among team members. And I think This time I learned from our group that leadership is very important in a group, leadership can better control the overall process and integrate the views and ideas of all people.

<p><strong style="font-size: 35px;">Group</strong><br/></p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >Working on HTML collaborate is a difficult part of this assessment because an HTML cannot be collaborating at the same time. Also, we need to ensure the template and the CSS style are same. Our group spent a lot of effort to discuss and plan the step of collaboration. In the  HTML collaborate, we successfully finished the assessment without any problem. This time we discuss the template each of us used first. An then we discuss the prototype of the website. Finally, we modify the template and upload to as a separate document. Peterâ€™s work is to collect and merge all the HTML to a file. As this assessment work smoothly, we might increase the difficulty next time. We might design our own HTML start from UI and prototype to increase group discussion. In the online discussion of our group homework 2, everyone attended the meeting on time and seriously discussed the opinions and ideas of each of us, and well assigned our own tasks.And everyone has done all the personal tasks perfectly. We should be more active in expressing our views and ideas in the online meeting discussion of group assignment 2, and we should prepare the ideas we want to express before the online meeting, instead of wasting a lot of time thinking in the meeting. Our communication after group online meeting is very constructive for our assignment 2. Our offline communication tools are outlook email, wechat group meeting and microsoft team. We can manage our time so we will not occupy otherâ€™s personal time. Moreover, we are able to find other membersâ€™ drawbacks in their work when we communicate with each other after group meetings to make sure our quality of work are high standard and fits the assignmentâ€™s requirements. Some aspects we need to correct for this group work, people sometimes cannot react otherâ€™s messages due to notification settings of our communication tools, that will decrease our efficiency on finishing a specific work. Furthermore, our time conflict among our group members make our group members feel frustrated during communication after group meetings.  After we discuss and assign each person's tasks online, there will be group cooperation. For example, two people complete the IT work part, and two people complete the IT technology part. When collaborating offline, usually two people will discuss with each other repeatedly and find the best answer. And the two parties will help each other to help each other find and share relevant information books. Usually offline cooperation cannot directly complete the task. It usually requires individuals to spend time to complete their respective text content. Due to the lack of communication after cooperation, the progress of text content will be different, and someone may even forget to complete the task in order to delay the whole progress of assignment. Generally speaking, the cooperation of our group is very successful. In terms of html, each group member has made a very big contribution to make the final work very beautiful. Secondly, when discussing online, everyone can participate in the meeting and discuss according to the original plan. After the discussion, the tasks assigned to everyone can be completed on time. The same as cooperation and communication that after the online group discussion, during this period, the division of labor is clear and completed quickly. But I hope that the next time the team cooperates, everyone can attend the meeting on time and check emails messages and other notifications in time, which may cause unnecessary delays.
