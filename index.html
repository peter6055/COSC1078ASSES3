                <p>Reflection: This is the third times everyone use GitHub. Everyone are familar with accept invited and pull/push using GitHub and success without any issues. GitHub is a really useful tool for programmer. It can manage all you modify and code without manually action. When I am working on HTML. I accidently delete a CSS file and fail the website styling. GitHub help me by giving a single click to rollback the data.</p><br></br>

<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >In this assessment, we had successfully collaborated together and finished our assessment 2. Everyone provides their idea in some of our discussion and everyone show their understanding of how this assessment work. The only thing that needs to be improved is our teammate didn’t familiar with using English to discuss online. This didn’t be a big problem as we can discuss in other language and keep our progress moving. I am quite surprised by the project every did. When we discussed our project idea and everyone needs to write it after meeting. Everyone can successfully finish their work without misunderstanding content. Especially who didn’t have any experience in IT. They produce professional research and analysis of the project idea. Teammate doing an overview, description and motivation are really hard working. They represent my project idea with a different viewpoint that I never think about. And focus more marketing stuff I didn’t write in assessment 1. I have learned how a group collaboration together to achieve a goal. This group make me understand an IT project cannot be finished by one person. Sometimes you can't make it on your own teamwork works best. I think I am quite familiar with using Github or website coding. In this project, I am like to help people didn’t familiar with HTML/CSS and Github. Also, I am leading to make everyone to try new things such as research on IT technology we never known or modify HTML. If there is another chance to start this project again.  I might recommend our team to try some new project idea rather than taking a market exiting idea.</p>
<br>
</br>
<p><strong style="font-size: 35px;">Kevin Mao</strong><br/></p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >I did lots of contribution for this introduction to information technology assignment 2, the personal information that I submitted to the group google doc is what I used from my assignment 1, as well as my learning style test, Idea job. In the group meeting, I contributed many valuable suggestions on Business to business industry data, financial information of online business to the whole group. I host two group meeting on Microsoft team to make sure everybody can have chanced to contribute their suggestions. I also contributed some advices on the leadership skills, teamwork skills on how to finish a group work among different cultures like East Asian culture, western culture. That will increase efficiency on team-work goals as far as I am concern.I contributed two IT technologies articles, the first one is machine learning, and the second one is cyber security.  I used to learn Andrew Ng’s machine learning course and I used to read his book <Machine learning yearning> and his website deeplearning.ai to absorb of knowledge for this article, and other professional sources like Stanford Artificial intelligence laboratory, MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Carnegie Mellon University artificial intelligence lab, Microsoft AI lab are the professional and reliable source that I found academic journal or report on machine learning, neural network and deep learning. Also, cyber security is another article that I wrote in IT technologies.  I use FBI cyber-crime database to search some most wanted report, and I use some professional reports from some cyber securities like FireEye to use examples to illustrate cyber security. Some source of data I used to from government websites like Chinese ministry of public security, Russian Federal government,  American central intelligence agency to find cyber-attack cases. The HTML file of industry data that I created is very simple, not like other members good-looking websites.</p>
<br>
</br>
<p><strong style="font-size: 35px;">Frocen Ling</strong><br/></p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >Totally speaking, I think everything has done very well through Peter’s management, every member of this group has done almost everything in time, and everyone has similar issues to finish, this is very hard to see. In this assignment, I am very honored to be responsible for the following projects and I think I have done well, except for the part that everyone must complete such as personal profile and industry data, I have finished the part of IT work, made IT work webpage and half text content of description of project ideal. There is an obvious problem that we need to improve. When we were discussing, we couldn’t come up with a good solution that we all agreed, we spent lots of time but less gain. There is one surprise thing, Peter is not only a good manager but also a good IT professional. The most important thing I learned from group work is, one plus one is not equal to two. I am a person who advocates personal strength, but this group work ensures me that the strength of a team is stronger than the absolute strength of a person.</p>

<br>
</br>
<p><strong style="font-size: 35px;">Young Yang</strong><br/></p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >Through this teamwork, all issues are progressing smoothly, and all the members cooperate very harmoniously. But what needs to be improved is that each member is not very active during the group discussion and needs to be reminded to actively participate in the recording. I hope that future cooperation can improve this. What surprised me through this group work is that each team member has so many technical skills and everyone has their own skills and even proficiency. Of course, a successful group work is inseparable from the active cooperation of everyone. So I think that each of us has a strong sense of responsibility to complete each task to lead to the smooth completion of the final task. Although this task also uses github and HTML related technologies, it is different from assignment1. This time the technical requirements are stricter and the degree of difficulty is higher. This time I am responsible for the design of the project idea webpage. I feel that I want to design a perfect website. My skills need to be improved and I need to practice more in the future.</p>

<br>
</br>
<p><strong style="font-size: 35px;">Karen Zhou</strong><br/></p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >In this group assignment 2, all our team members did a good job of completing their respective tasks and were able to complete the group assignment well. Although everyone has put forward their own ideas and opinions, we should be more active in the group discussion. We should be more active in expressing our opinions and ideas. During the discussion meeting, we allocated our respective tasks well, made good use of Github and HTML in our group assignment 2, and put a lot of time and effort into completing our respective parts. Everyone did a great job on their part. In this group assignment, I learned that I should be more active in expressing my views during the discussion, and I should prepare all my ideas before the discussion. This will make the discussion meeting better. Moreover, I have learned the communication methods with team members. This assignment requires cooperation and communication among team members. And I think This time I learned from our group that leadership is very important in a group, leadership can better control the overall process and integrate the views and ideas of all people.
</p>

<br>
</br>

<p><strong style="font-size: 35px;">Group</strong><br/></p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight:500;" >Working on HTML collaborate is a difficult part of this assessment because an HTML cannot be collaborating at the same time. Also, we need to ensure the template and the CSS style are same. Our group spent a lot of effort to discuss and plan the step of collaboration. In the  HTML collaborate, we successfully finished the assessment without any problem. This time we discuss the template each of us used first. An then we discuss the prototype of the website. Finally, we modify the template and upload to as a separate document. Peter’s work is to collect and merge all the HTML to a file. As this assessment work smoothly, we might increase the difficulty next time. We might design our own HTML start from UI and prototype to increase group discussion. In the online discussion of our group homework 2, everyone attended the meeting on time and seriously discussed the opinions and ideas of each of us, and well assigned our own tasks.And everyone has done all the personal tasks perfectly. We should be more active in expressing our views and ideas in the online meeting discussion of group assignment 2, and we should prepare the ideas we want to express before the online meeting, instead of wasting a lot of time thinking in the meeting. Our communication after group online meeting is very constructive for our assignment 2. Our offline communication tools are outlook email, wechat group meeting and microsoft team. We can manage our time so we will not occupy other’s personal time. Moreover, we are able to find other members’ drawbacks in their work when we communicate with each other after group meetings to make sure our quality of work are high standard and fits the assignment’s requirements. Some aspects we need to correct for this group work, people sometimes cannot react other’s messages due to notification settings of our communication tools, that will decrease our efficiency on finishing a specific work. Furthermore, our time conflict among our group members make our group members feel frustrated during communication after group meetings.  After we discuss and assign each person's tasks online, there will be group cooperation. For example, two people complete the IT work part, and two people complete the IT technology part. When collaborating offline, usually two people will discuss with each other repeatedly and find the best answer. And the two parties will help each other to help each other find and share relevant information books. Usually offline cooperation cannot directly complete the task. It usually requires individuals to spend time to complete their respective text content. Due to the lack of communication after cooperation, the progress of text content will be different, and someone may even forget to complete the task in order to delay the whole progress of assignment. Generally speaking, the cooperation of our group is very successful. In terms of html, each group member has made a very big contribution to make the final work very beautiful. Secondly, when discussing online, everyone can participate in the meeting and discuss according to the original plan. After the discussion, the tasks assigned to everyone can be completed on time. The same as cooperation and communication that after the online group discussion, during this period, the division of labor is clear and completed quickly. But I hope that the next time the team cooperates, everyone can attend the meeting on time and check emails messages and other notifications in time, which may cause unnecessary delays.
